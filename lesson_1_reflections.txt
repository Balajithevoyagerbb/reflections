How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Most often bugs are either typo or syntax error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help to quickly debug the error as we exactly know at whichplace the changes has been made from last working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros is we commit only logical changes therefore the code is consistent and meaningful to a programmer and restore will give a functional code.
Cons is there might me human error of not commiting and ens up in a big junk of code and also if suddenly computer crashes we may risk loosing all the recent code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because there are dependent on each other for the entire program to work.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log provides all the checkpoints when commit has made
git diff provides details of changes that has made between two commits
